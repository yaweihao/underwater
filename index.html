    <h1>Unplug Underwater</h1>
    <p class="tagline">Our Story</p>
    <p>
      After nearly a decade working at a big tech company, where goals and results often felt distant, abstract, and emotions were left behind; I found myself longing for something more tangible, more human... 
    </p>
    <p>
      My first experience teaching kids swimming dates back to 2012, when I was still a college student in China. That summer, I taught two classes at a local swimming school. I don't remember every detail, but I vividly remember the transformation: kids from fearing and crying to being friends with the water, to swimming lap after lap, to even putting on a wide grin stretched across their face after a tough set. I felt something at the time, something unforgettable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast forward to 2025. The world has evolved. Kids nowadays are glued to digital screens much like adults who build the technologies. Getting kids in the water today is not only learning a new skill but also helping them unplug, focus, and engage with their surroundings. In the water, there are no screens, only presence, and pure emotions flowing as freely as the current itself. 
    </p>
    <p>        
      This is why I started Unplug Underwater, to make that feeling I first experienced in 2012 a lasting one. This journey is not just about teaching kids how to swim. It's about helping them (and maybe myself) rediscover what it feels like to be fully alive in the moment. Every splash, every smile, every milestone is a reminder that we are making an impact, small or big. Sometimes I wonder about those kids I taught in China. Where are they now, did their first stroke carry forward into other parts of their lives?
