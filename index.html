    <h1>Unplug Underwater</h1>
    <p class="tagline">Our Story</p>
    <p>I’ve always loved the water. Not in some poetic, mystical way, just in the way how it felt. I was 21 the first time I taught someone else to swim. It was a hot summer in China, and I had picked up a part-time job coaching kids at a local pool. I didn’t have a plan. I just needed some work. But that summer changed me.</p>

    <p>My students were scared about water at first. Some refused to get in. Some cried. But slowly, something shifted. One kicked five meters. One let go of the wall. One swam the full length with their head down. I don’t remember all their names, or what drills we did on which days. But I do remember their smiles - wide, wild, impossible smiles that seemed to come out of nowhere. I remember thinking: <em>this is what joy looks like in real-time.</em></p>

    <p>I went back to school that fall. Then came grad school. Then came the job in tech. Life moved forward. Faster. Bigger. Somewhere along the way, I stopped swimming.</p>

    <p>Years later, I was living in the U.S., working long hours at a company with thousands and thousands of people. We were building amazing things. But my days were full of screens, meetings, deadlines, outcomes. Everything measurable. Everything optimized. And yet... something felt off. I missed the part of life you can’t track in metrics. I missed the feeling of being in the water — present, weightless, unplugged.</p>

    <p>In 2025, I started Unplug Underwater. It’s not a startup. It’s not a growth hack. It’s just me, sharing something I believe in with kids who are growing up in a world more distracted than ever. I want them to feel what I felt back then: the thrill of a first breath after a good lap, the quiet joy of floating still, the confidence that comes not from a grade, but from knowing their body can glide.</p>

    <p>Teaching swimming again, after all these years, brought something back to life in me. I still wonder about those first kids I taught. I don’t know where they are now. But I hope, somewhere, they still remember how to swim — and how it made them feel.</p>
