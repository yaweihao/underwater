      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Unplug Underwater was born from a simple but powerful idea—making a real impact, one lesson at a time. After years in the corporate world, where results often felt distant and abstract, we found joy in something more immediate and meaningful: teaching kids how to swim.
      </p>
      <p>
        In today’s world, kids are often glued to digital screens, lost in a world of notifications and endless scrolling. But in the water, there are no screens—just the present moment. Swimming pulls them away from devices, helping them unplug, focus, and truly engage with their surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Unplug Underwater, it’s not just about swimming—it’s about rediscovering the joy of being in the moment.
